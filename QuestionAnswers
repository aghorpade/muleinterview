#1 -  Introduce yourself and daily activities or project responsibilities
This is generic question and it depends on you how do you represent yourself. E.g.
Myself Amit, Completed graduation in computer science engineering in 2008. having an experience of 12 years in an IT industry. Been part of different domain,complex and industry 
software development lifecycle. Current working with an Insurance client in a complex digital transformation program which is high demading,tight on schedule and with more complexity.
Having an experience as a Developer,Team Leader,Integration Design Lead and Manager. Worked on Retail Banking,Insurance, Hospitapitality domain projects. blah blah blah ......
Currently being as a Mulesoft INtegration Design lead, i need to take care of new business requirement understanding and designing solution which is reusable,adhere to existing design patterns,
scalable. Handling a team at onshore and offshore with respect to design changes,code review,best practices implementation and delivery timeline.

#2 - Which features of Mulesoft are being used in your program?
We are using customer hosted runtime plane(mule version 3.9.2) while for metadata using anypoint platform hosted control plane which gives benefit to control business data into customer hosted environment,
putting dedicated load balancer for custom domain ,certificate solution and on premise/cloud datacentre/db access. URL bases load balancer in NFT env to support scalability.
Exchange for template,api discovery and api details on public portal for third part. Property file encryption using security configuration. Munit for unit testing. Anypoint studio for 
mule application development.Log4j configuration for push logs into graylog/server. Almost(more than 10) all connectors are used for integration e.g. HTTP, WS,FTP, SMTP, Kafka, Mongodb,Salesforce, DB,JMS,VM
All scopes are used in application sync, async, scatter gather, foreach, choice
Note- Make sure whatever feature you will point out here,you should have clear crystal understanding on it and use case.

#3 - what are resposibilities of Mulesoft Integration Design lead -
My job as a design lead is to attend scope gathering sessions with business, understand current scope and if any future scope. All intergrations partners their integration patterns and use case.
After understandning requirement and scope, check existing design patterns and reuse if any can be or come up with new soltion design which will adhere to existing established design patterns or 
present new design pattern to Architecture forum for approval. Handover design solution to offshore and follow up on intergration parties n team for any issues/concerns and feedback.
Present new /existing design changes to architecture forum and deliver those as per timeline. Use best practicse and get it implemented in program.

------------- Mule 4 Specific Questions --------------
#4 - What are the various types of Exception Handling?
Global Exception Handling - use case to use it across mutliple flows with common stratergy
Catch Exception Handling - Try catch can be used acrosss specific flow or component to use it in transaction or specific use case
Choice Exception Handling -
Default Exception Handling
Rollback Exception Handling

#5 - What you mean by shared resource and how do you achieve it?
Connector/connnector configuration can be made common across application under mule domain project which is called as shared resource. You need to have mule domain project under which
you can define such connectors and then all mule applications will be using mule domain for shared resource. this is available only for customer hosted mule runtime application 
as on cloudhub it doesnt support mule domain project structure.

#6 -Which connector does support transactions and what is difference between XA and non-XA transactions?
Database, JMS, VM connector support transaction feature. Two transaction types-
a.Single Resource(local) - Normally used on single resource,faster and local transaction, should be used on same connector opertaions n use same global config, no nested transactions support
b. Exentended Architecture(XA) - support nested transaction,two phase commit,slower but reliable in distributed systems.
TransactionActions matter a lot in case of XA transactions 
Always Begin - always start a new transaction- in XA it creates new transaction as a nested transaction. in single reosurce already existing transaction then it throws error
Always JOin - joins an existing transaction, throws error if no existing transaction
BeginOrJoin- it joins if existing else begin new transaction
JoinIfpossible- join if exiting transaction but wil not create new tranasction
InDfifferent -Do not treat actions as a transaction
None - Do not initiate a transaction.
Not_supported - Execute outside any existent transaction.

#7 what are different type of variables and attributes and how is scope of those?
in mule 4 we have variables and inbound/outbound attributes which are represented as attributes.
Mule 4 has simpleied mule event model as below -
----------------------
|   Mule Event       |
|   --------------   |
|  | Mule Message |  |
|  |   Attributes |  |
|  |              |  |
|  |   Payload    |  |
|   --------------   |
|                    |
|    Variables       |
|--------------------|
Variables do propogate within flows when referenced using flow reference while they do not propogate over component automatically
Attributes replaces inbound properties of Mule 3 message ,it provide easy access on source attributes as well as we can store them in variables easily #[attributes.queryParams.filter]
Sessions,attachements and outbound properties are not supported in mule 4 now.

#8 In which scenarios you will use scatter-gather and choice case scenarions? real time example from your project.
Scatter-gather - > when u need to gather data from more than one system and they do no have any dependency as well as u need to achieve result within given timeline which is critical.
We used scatter gather in case of multiple third party integration where those independent and important to collect data within a stipulated timeline.
Choice case router is used normally to choose one route depeneding on condition e.g. send message to a flow when country is part of europe. it comes with default case which is
mandatory. Ref Link- https://docs.mulesoft.com/mule-runtime/4.3/about-components

#9 What are scenarios in which you will use cache scope and what are implementation ways?
cache scope is used to store and retrieve frequently used data. We have used cache scope for data which is same for vehicle and coming fro third part.In this case we call thrid party if cache is missed
and store it into cache for next calls as data doesn't get change over period. You can use object store to implement cache scope along with you can database,redis cache or java class  which implements custom cache scope.
Ref Link- https://docs.mulesoft.com/mule-runtime/4.3/cache-scope

#10 what is difference between api autodiscovery vs api proxy and when to use what?
API Proxy typical usage -  Either when you want to leverage API Gateway capabilities and your backend API is not based on Mule Runtime, 
or when your API is based on Mule Runtime but you are unable to define the corresponding Autodiscovery element because it is a closed code.
*you can manage non-mule applications using api manager for api proxy comes into picture
Auto Discovery Usage- onfiguring autodiscovery allows a deployed Mule runtime engine (Mule) application to connect with API Manager to download and manage policies and to generate analytics data. 
Additionally, with autodiscovery, you can configure your Mule applications to act as their own API proxy.
Enhance capabilities of api manager e.g. security,analytics on runtime api.
